    <h2>Our history</h2>
    <section class="texto">
      <p>
        For many years, <strong>Bethany</strong> has been baking the most
        delicious pies at her home. In 2013, we opened our first store in
        Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People
        from all over the world fell in love with the soft cakes, heavenly
        cheese cakes, spicy apple pies... The store became a success in no time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In 2015, noless than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop
        moved into a larger building. After receiving many requests, it became
        clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies from the
        comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now
        looking at the result of this: our very own webstore, making it possible
        to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like it!
